The present script extracts a tidy data set based on the work in wearable devices and their dataset. The data was published in:

 Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012
 
 The variables are:
 1) Activity, identified with a text label
 2) Subject ID, numeric
- averages and standard deviations of Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables

Transformations from original data:
1) Merging of the train and test datasets, originally intended for machine learning
2) Merging with the activity and subject labels
3) Extracting measurements on the averages and standard deviations of each measurement
4) Averaging values that belong to the same activity and subject
